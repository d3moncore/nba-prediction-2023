This repository contains the research and development of a machine learning model aimed at predicting the outcome of NBA basketball games. The model analyzes statistics collected from previous games played between teams over the past year, incorporating both team and player performance metrics.

## Abstract

This research paper explores the development of a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NBA basketball games by analyzing statistics collected from previous games played between teams over the past year. The study aims to build a model that can analyze relevant metrics and trends to determine the outcome of a game by taking into account recent performance and historical data. Utilizing data from the 2016-17 season to the current season, the model will be trained on team and player performance statistics, and predictions will be made by isolating specific metrics relevant to winning. This study fills a gap in the field of outcome prediction for basketball games and offers insights into how machine learning can be used to analyze and predict the outcome of sports games.
